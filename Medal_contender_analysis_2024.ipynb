    "# Paris 2024 Olympic Medal Contender Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "I will use data from worldatheltics.org to predict the most likely medalists for the Paris 2024 Olympics for select track and field events. I will use the data from the past two years for each qualifying athlete to predict their performance in the 2024 Olympics. The predictive model will consist of two parts: (1) a non-linear function (likely a Gompertz growth model) to model the athlete's performance trajectory (e.g., improving, declining, stable) going into the Paris Olympics and (2) a Monte Carlo simulation to account for uncertainty in the predictions. The non-linear model will limit the athlete's performance as they approach/surpass their peak performance (personal best or PB) -- the closer to their PB they are, . The Monte Carlo simulation will use the athlete's consistency from event to event to determine the uncertainty in the athlete's performance in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each event, extract the performance data for each event by qualifying athlete for 2023 and 2024. This will allow us to analyse and compare the athletes' performances in the two years leading up to the Olympics.\n",
    "- Correct for wind conditions in the performance data for events where wind conditions can affect performance (e.g. track events).\n",
    "- Model athlete performance data to predict the top athletes for each event in 2024.\n",
    "- Modelling will involve determining an athlete's trajectory (e.g. improving, declining) relative to their personal best performance. The trajectory will be converted to a non-linear function (Gompertz growth model) to limit the athlete's performance as they approach/surpass their peak performance.\n",
    "- Modelling will also involve determining an athlete's consistency from event to event. The consistency will be used to determine the uncertainty in the athlete's performance in 2024 and incorporated as a parameter in the Monte Carlo simulation (see below).\n",
    "- The trajectory and consistency will be used to predict the athlete's performance in 2024 using a Monte Carlo simulation to account for uncertainty in the predictions."

We'll store the data separate dataframes for each event with the following naming convention: athletes_{event_name}_df. Each row will represent an athlete and will contain the following columns: \"QP\" (Qualifying Position), \"Nat\" (country), \"Athlete\", \"Status\" (how they qualified), \"Details\" (details about their qualifying performance).\n",

    "The 'StaleElementReferenceException' error comes up intermittently. This occurs when the page is reloaded and the target element (\"tbody\", \"tr\", or \"td\") is no longer attached to the DOM (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27003423/staleelementreferenceexception-on-python-selenium). This can be resolved by refreshing the page and re-finding the element. I've added WebDriverWait .until to the main scraping element, \"tbody\", but the error still pops up occasionally. I'll add a try/except block to catch the error and refresh the page if it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most elegant solution: It may be better to extract the data directly all the way down the tree to the \"td\" elements, rather than extracting the data at the \"tbody\" level and then the \"tr\" level and then iterating through the \"td\" elements. This would reduce the number of times we need to interact with the page and may reduce the likelihood of the error."
